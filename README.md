# LateChecker
This is a program to check if any repositories within a list of repositories have been committed to past a given time.
## Prerequisites
You will need to have all of your repositories in one folder. This can be accomplished by using the GitHub classroom cli to clone all the repos for a given assignment.
Open a terminal at that directory.
You will need to have a python interpreter installed. This can be done by going to python.org/downloads.
## Usage
Enter ```python3 script.py``` in your terminal to run the script and enter the date and time when prompted.
It may be ```python script.py``` depending on your python installation.
